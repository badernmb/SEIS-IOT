Smart Water Bottle

The ultimate goal of the project is to encourage and motivate you to drink water by track the water in intake and how much you drink water each time. Whenever you drink water the progress gets update and the bottle behaves differently by lighting red, Yellow and blue .In addition of that you SMS will be sent when you reach the target. Another piece of the project is a reminder in every 6 houres if the progress doesn't change.Moreover, every day at midnight, a script runs and updates the progress of the day and keep the history.
